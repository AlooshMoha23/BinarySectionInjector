#  BinarySectionInjector

Introduction:

BinarySectionInjector is a tool designed to inject arbitrary code into ELF binaries. This project aims to manipulate ELF files .

Functionality:

BinarySectionInjector Inject takes five arguments:

1. Target ELF file: The ELF binary to be injected.
2. Injected code file: A binary file containing the machine code to be injected.
3. New section name: The name to be assigned to the newly created section.
4. Base address: The base address of the injected code.
5. Modify entry point: A boolean flag indicating whether to modify the entry point of the binary.
   
Usage:

Compile your assembly code using nasm.
Run Isos Inject with the required arguments.
The tool will inject the code into the target ELF file, creating a new section and updating the program headers accordingly.
If the modify entry point flag is set, the entry point of the binary will be modified to call the injected code.
